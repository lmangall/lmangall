### Hi there üëã

I finished the curriulum of 42 Berlin based monstly on C and C++: after coding our own libraries, we code our own shell.
Currently finishing an internship at Dassault Systems, the task is to augment the data and implement an AI agent in Catia
My current side project revolves around molecules for the flavor and perfume industry : https://www.oumamie.xyz it's a Next.js frontend and Node.js and Express backend on an Oracle server.
Last relatively big project was [ChatPay](https://github.com/TON-42), where after a hackathon win we tried to go the startup way.

You can check out [this small project](https://enterprise-decision-tracker.vercel.app/) I did on a 3 days span as a challenge where I tried to implement as many good practices and tools as I could (read more on the [readme](https://github.com/lmangall/enterprise_decision_tracker) on such a high paced project.

As a fast side project I also did LoveLetter, [üíå check it out]( https://langgenie.vercel.app/loveletter) if you want to receive a cheesy love letter just for you. It is voluntarily over the top (OpenAI üå°Ô∏è to the max), which makes for a fun love letter, and the app provide you with TTS (Text To Speech) and translation (via Deepl API) functionality.

I am really proud of finishing the core curricullum of 42 Berlin, a coding school like no other (well, maybe Epitech).

Cheers,
Leo
