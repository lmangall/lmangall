### Hi there üëã

Project I'm currently most working on [Futura](https://github.com/552020/futura_prealpha) (web3)

I finished the curriulum of 42 Berlin based monstly on C and C++: after coding our own libraries, we code our own shell and webserver.
Finished an internship at Dassault Systems augmenting the data to prepare Catia's AI agent, giving a dinosaur code base AI wings.
On the side I learned more recent language and stacks (ts...) and I am present in the Web3 scene, winning several hackathons and an ICP grant lately.
My current side project revolves around molecules for the flavor and perfume industry : https://www.oumamie.xyz it's full-stack: Next.js frontend and Node.js and Express backend on an Oracle server.
Last relatively big project was [ChatPay](https://github.com/TON-42), where after a hackathon win we tried to go the startup way.

You can check out [this small project](https://enterprise-decision-tracker.vercel.app/) I did on a 3 days span as a challenge where I tried to implement as many good practices and tools as I could (read more on the [readme](https://github.com/lmangall/enterprise_decision_tracker) ) on such a high paced project.

As my first web app I did LoveLetter, [üíå check it out]( https://langgenie.vercel.app/loveletter) if you want to receive a cheesy love letter just for you. It is voluntarily over the top (OpenAI üå°Ô∏è to the max), which makes for a fun love letter, and the app provide you with TTS (Text To Speech) and translation (via Deepl API) functionality.

Cheers,
Leo
