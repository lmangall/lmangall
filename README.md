### Hi there 👋

I have worked on very different industries (🛥️, 🔪, 🚲, 💬) and I am now focusing on code, learning the latin of programmation (C, naturally) at 42Berlin (a competitive programming school for software engineers with soft skills).

At the moment I work on a collection of language learning web apps (fun, useful or both) while teaching myself a webdev tech stack (I like to learn by doing). These will be shared with the non-dev public as part of a marketing campaign in collaboration with a french teacher and instagrammer colleague.

As instance, [this one will generate a cheesy love letter](https://loveletter-seven.vercel.app/) custom to you. It is ridiculously and voluntarily (OpenAI 🌡️ at the max) over the top, which makes for a fun love letter, and the app provide you with TTS and translation (via Deepl API) functionality.


Cheers,
Leo
