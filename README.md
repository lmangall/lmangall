### Hi there 👋

I am currently focused on [ChatPay](https://github.com/TON-42), where I serve as a co-founder. Apart from business meetings and strategy, I do mostly ChatPay's frontend. From conventional commits to mocked API endpoints, I'm proud of how well-organized the project is. As part of a small team, I'm also familiar with the backend and database, stepping in whenever needed.

As a fast side project I did LoveLetter, [💌 check it out](https://langgenie.xyz/loveletter) if you want to receive a cheesy love letter just for you (custom thanks to OpenAI API). It is ridiculously and voluntarily over the top (OpenAI 🌡️ to the max), which makes for a fun love letter, and the app provide you with TTS (Text To Speech) and translation (via Deepl API) functionality.

I am also super proud of finishing the core curricullum of 42 Berlin, a coding school like no other (well, maybe Epitech).

Cheers,
Leo
