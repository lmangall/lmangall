# Hi there üëã

I have worked on very different industries :
- üõ•Ô∏è
- üî™
- üö≤
- üí¨

I am now focusing on code, learning C at 42Berlin (a programming school for software engineers with soft skills).

I currently work on a few language learning web apps while teaching myself a webdev tech stack (=> learn by doing). These will be shared with the non-dev public as part of a marketing campaign in collaboration with a french teacher and instagrammer colleague.

As instance, [this one will generate a cheesy love letter](https://loveletter-seven.vercel.app/) custom to you. It is ridiculously and voluntarily (OpenAI üå°Ô∏è at the max) over the top, which makes for a fun love letter, and the app provide you with TTS and translation (via Deepl API) functionality.


Cheers,
Leo
