### Hi there üëã

I am currently focused on [ChatPay](https://github.com/TON-42), where I serve as a co-founder. Apart from business meetings and strategy, I do mostly ChatPay's frontend. From conventional commits to mocked API endpoints, I'm proud of how well-organized the project is. As part of a small team, I'm also familiar with the backend and database, stepping in whenever needed.

You can check out [this small project](https://enterprise-decision-tracker.vercel.app/) I did on a 3 days span as a challenge where I tried to implement as many good practices and tools as I could (read more on the [readme](https://github.com/lmangall/enterprise_decision_tracker) on such a high paced project.

As a fast side project I also did LoveLetter, [üíå check it out](https://langgenie.xyz/loveletter) if you want to receive a cheesy love letter just for you (custom thanks to OpenAI API). It is ridiculously and voluntarily over the top (OpenAI üå°Ô∏è to the max), which makes for a fun love letter, and the app provide you with TTS (Text To Speech) and translation (via Deepl API) functionality.

I am also super proud of finishing the core curricullum of 42 Berlin, a coding school like no other (well, maybe Epitech).

Cheers,
Leo
