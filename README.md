### Hi there 👋

Learning coding at 42Berlin: a programming school for software engineers with soft skills.

I currently work on a few language learning web apps while teaching myself a webdev tech stack (=> learn by doing). These will be shared with the non-dev public as part of a marketing campaign in collaboration with a french teacher and instagrammer colleague.

As instance, [this one will generate a cheesy love letter 💌](https://langgenie.xyz/loveletter) just for you (custom thanks to OpenAI API). It is ridiculously and voluntarily over the top (OpenAI 🌡️ to the max), which makes for a fun love letter, and the app provide you with TTS (Text To Speech) and translation (via Deepl API) functionality.


Cheers,
Leo
