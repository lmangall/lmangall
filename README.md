### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Project I'm currently most working on: **[Futura](https://github.com/552020/futura_prealpha)** â€“ a hybrid **Web3 and Web2** platform leveraging **ICP or AWS S3 storage**.

I finished the curriculum at **42 Berlin**, mostly based on C and C++: after coding our own libraries, we built our own **shell**, **webserver**....
Then I did an internship at **Dassault Systems**, augmenting data and working on the architecture of **Catia's future AI agent**, giving a dinosaur code base AI wings.

My current side project revolves around molecules for the flavor and perfume industry: **[Oumamie](https://www.oumamie.xyz)** â€“ a full-stack application with **Next.js frontend** ([frontend repo](https://github.com/lmangall/flaveur)) and **Node.js/Express backend** ([backend repo](https://github.com/lmangall/flaveur_backend)) deployed on **Oracle servers**.

Another relatively big project was **[ChatPay](https://github.com/TON-42)**, where after a hackathon win we tried to go the startup route.

Cheers,  
Leo
